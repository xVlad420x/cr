This is the configuration file, be mindful to not change the spacing, simply remove default values and remove them with the desired outcome.
1) We will now list important key binds, make sure to follow the proper formatting. For shift, alt, and control please specify left or right. For arrows just say: "up" for the up key and so on. Note f1-12 is defined.
Forward = w
Backward = s
Left = a
Right = d
Use = z
Crouch = alt_left
Sprint = shift_left
Console = `
Jump = space

2) We will consider when we want the bot to stop. If a value is true, the bot will stop. If false, then it will be considered a warning, but will keep going. The 1st value is when the code is suspected to be found. The 2nd value is when the bot died to a player, the 3rd is a death to an animal, the 4th is when a bag/bed was destroyed, the 5th is when the door has been locked out from codes.
Code_Found = True
Player_Death = True
Animal_Death = False
Spawn_Destroyed = True
Door_Ban = True
